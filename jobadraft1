joba issue draft1

Hi,
Looking for some help.
I'm trying to strip down some of the complexity I don't fully understand, but also think I don't need in my situation.

Original situation was : esmart3 --> sintech rs485 to rs232 adaptor to com port on pc for mygreensolar monitor.
Discovered skagmos python script sevaral months ago. Set up dedicated mini pc running ubuntu server. Enabled ssh and a serial console. I have a third party UI that I send strings over the serial console that runs (./) or ^C (\x03) skagmos script.
The UI parses the serial console into javascript which I then send the stats to influx.

Here's where I'm held up.
I'd like to replace the ubuntu server with a dedicated board for both of my esmart3 controllers. (giving paralleling dumb controllers a go)
 I have used the arduino IDE and UNOs for a while and am aware of the difference between rs232 3.3v (ttl?) and dedicated ports
